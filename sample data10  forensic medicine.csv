CDH causes pulmonary hypoplasia (bilateral) by compressing the developing lung, which results in smaller bronchi, less bronchial branching, and less alveolar surface area than normal lungs in infants. Pulmonary hypertension is due to increased thickness of arteriolar smooth muscle and also by multiple local and systemic vasoactive factors.","""['Sabiston Textbook of Surgery 20th Edition Page no: 1863-1864', """"Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery - 27th Edition Page no: 133"""", 'Current Diagnosis and Treatment: Surgery - 14th Edition Page No. 1229']""",Sabiston textbook,venkata lakshmi
